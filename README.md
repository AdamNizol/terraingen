# Terrain Generator
### [Live Demo](https://adamnizol.github.io/terraingen/)

Terrain Generator is a 3d terrain generation project using Perlin noise. The idea came from a Youtube video by Daniel Shiffman (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKB1hWWedMk).

Although it was largely based off the coding video, I decided to make it in the web instead of as a java application while adding extra options to change settings like steepness, level of detail, height constraints, texture settings and a speed slider that all work in real-time. I further managed to solve the issue that Daniel Shiffman had where the terrain would appear to warp unnaturally at lower speeds.
